# NumPy Tutorials

The `NumPy_Tutorials` folder contains small Python scripts that introduce core NumPy functionality. Run them in order to build up your understanding of array programming. Each example can be executed with `python` followed by the file name.

### 0. Create arrays
`python 00_create_arrays.py`

Demonstrates several ways to create NumPy arrays including zeros and identity matrices.

### 1. Array math
`python 01_array_math.py`

Shows element-wise arithmetic, vectorized functions and basic aggregations.

### 2. Indexing and slicing
`python 02_indexing_slicing.py`

Covers slicing, boolean masks and fancy indexing to access data efficiently.

### 3. Broadcasting
`python 03_broadcasting.py`

Illustrates how operations automatically expand array shapes without copies.

### 4. Random numbers & statistics
`python 04_random_and_statistics.py`

Uses NumPy's random module to draw samples and compute statistics like mean, standard deviation and simple histograms.

### 5. Linear algebra
`python 05_linear_algebra.py`

Performs matrix multiplication, computes a determinant and finds the inverse of a matrix using `numpy.linalg`.

### 6. Polynomial fitting
`python 06_polynomial_fit.py`

Generates noisy quadratic data, fits a polynomial with `numpy.polyfit` and evaluates the fitted curve.

### 7. Saving and loading
`python 07_saving_loading.py`

Shows how to persist arrays using `np.save`, `np.load` and `savetxt`.

### 8. Fourier transforms
`python 08_fourier_transform.py`

Computes the discrete Fourier transform of a synthetic signal using `numpy.fft`.

Feel free to modify the scripts or use them as starting points for your own experiments with NumPy!

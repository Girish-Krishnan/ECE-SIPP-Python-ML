# Foundations: NumPy and pandas

There are two main ways to run the code in this directory:

## Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

Click on the badge below to open the notebook in Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Girish-Krishnan/ECE-SIPP-Python-ML/blob/main/0_Foundations/foundations.ipynb)

The notebook contains step-by-step explanations for beginners. No local installation is required when using Colab.

## Option 2: Python Scripts

Each script corresponds to a section in the notebook. Install the required libraries if needed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

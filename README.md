# Python Machine Learning Examples

This repository contains a collection of small tutorials for learning the basics of machine learning and scientific computing with Python.

## Directory overview
- **Machine_Learning_Tutorial.ipynb** – introductory notebook covering classic algorithms using NumPy.
- **NumPy_Tutorials/** – short scripts that teach core NumPy concepts. See the [README](NumPy_Tutorials/README.md) inside the folder for details.
- **OpenCV_Tutorials/** – webcam demos built with OpenCV. See the [README](OpenCV_Tutorials/README.md) inside the folder for instructions.
- **Deep_Learning_Tutorials/** – PyTorch examples from MLPs to object detection. See the [README](Deep_Learning_Tutorials/README.md) inside the folder.

Open each folder above to follow the individual tutorials.

## Opening the notebook in Google Colab
1. Navigate to the notebook file on GitHub.
2. Replace `github.com` in the URL with `colab.research.google.com/github`.
   - Example: `https://colab.research.google.com/github/<username>/<repo>/blob/main/Machine_Learning_Tutorial.ipynb`
3. Press Enter and Colab will load the notebook so you can execute the code online.

Colab provides free GPU/CPU resources, making it a convenient way to experiment with the code without installing anything locally.

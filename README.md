# Machine Learning Tutorial

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `Machine_Learning_Tutorial.ipynb` which introduces machine learning concepts using Python and NumPy. The tutorial walks through implementations of models such as linear regression, logistic regression, k-NN, decision trees and k-Means. It now also includes a worked example on the `sklearn` digits dataset (a smaller version of MNIST) so you can practice on real-world data.

You can open the notebook locally or in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the examples interactively.

## Opening in Google Colab

1. Navigate to the notebook file on GitHub.
2. Replace `github.com` in the URL with `colab.research.google.com/github`.
   - Example: `https://colab.research.google.com/github/<username>/<repo>/blob/main/Machine_Learning_Tutorial.ipynb`
3. Press Enter and Colab will load the notebook so you can execute the code online.

Colab provides free GPU/CPU resources, making it a convenient way to experiment with the code without installing anything locally.

# Unsupervised Machine Learning Tutorials

This folder contains short examples of clustering and dimensionality reduction using scikit-learn.

## Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

Click on the badge below to open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser, in Google Colab:

This option does not require you to install anything locally. The notebook contains step-by-step explanations and runnable code cells.

### 0. k-means clustering
`python 00_kmeans_clustering.py`

Performs k-means clustering with three clusters on the Iris features and prints the cluster counts and centers.

### 1. Principal component analysis
`python 01_pca_digits.py`

Reduces the dimensionality of the digits dataset to two components using PCA and prints the explained variance ratio.

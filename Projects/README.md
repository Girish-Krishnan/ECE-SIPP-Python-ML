# Project Ideas

This folder contains example datasets and starter code for practice projects. The notebook can be opened directly in Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Girish-Krishnan/ECE-SIPP-Python-ML/blob/main/Projects/dataset_projects.ipynb)

Inside the notebook you'll find small code snippets for loading a few datasets using `pandas`:

- Titanic survival data
- Wine quality ratings
- Palmer penguins measurements

Each section also lists project ideas such as cleaning the data, exploring correlations, and building models. Feel free to extend the starter code and try out your own approaches!
